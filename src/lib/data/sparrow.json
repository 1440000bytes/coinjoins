  "overview": {
    "point_1": "Whirlpool is a Zerolink protocol-based coinjoin implementation that splits the toxic change and collects the coordinator fee before participating in mix transactions. It does this by first performing a premix transaction (Tx0) where UTXOs selected for coinjoin are consolidated and resized to the pool denomination. There is a separate wallet account for non-mixing, premixing, post-mixing, and bad bank (change output separated in the premix transaction).",
    "point_2": "Whirlpool coinjoin transactions have a minimum of 5 inputs and 5 outputs, the latter all of the same value. There is a minimum of 2 premixers (new entrants) in a coinjoin transaction, who pay the mining transaction fees for the remaining users, the remixers. There are four remix pools to choose from with different output denominations: 0.001, 0.01, 0.05, 0.5 BTC. The maximum amount of bitcoin a user can register at once per pool is 70 times the output denomination (35 BTC for the 0.5 BTC pool), and the maximum number of UTXOs to aggregate on Tx0 is also 70.",
    "point_3": "The pool coordinator charges a one-time flat fee of 3.5-5% of the pool denomination. For the first mixing transaction, you pay a mining fee depending on the profile you choose, slow, normal or fast, depending on how fast you want your first coinjoin transaction to be confirmed. Mining fees vary depending on the blockspace market. Remixing is free of mining and coordinator fees. You can never remix with a UTXO you just mixed with in a previous transaction.",
    "point_4": "Whenever fees are adjusted lower, there are surge cycles where the mining fees allocated by premixer UTXOs (new entrants) are sufficient for larger transactions. There can be 6, 7, or 8 exits in Surge Cycles. These coinjoin transactions give you a slightly higher anonymity rate. If you have enough UTXOs on the post-mix wallet, Sparrow will automatically create a STONEWALL (fake two person coinjoin) transaction when you spend coins, to create further obfuscation."
  },
  "benefits": {
    "point_1": "Total fees can be as low as 0.05%: If you register a lot of bitcoin, you will pay very little as coordinator fee because you pay the same amount if you register 0.5 or 35 bitcoin. You only pay mining fees for the premix Tx0 and for the first coinjoin transaction.",
    "point_2": "Zerolink-based coinjoin transactions implement Chaumian blind signatures to protect the user’s input to output linkage from the coordinator.",
    "point_3": "There are no terms of service for Sparrow or Whirlpool and there is no announced blacklisting policy.",
    "point_4": "The anonymity set gain of Whirlpool coinjoin transactions is easy to calculate and understand, the terms used are backward looking anonymity set and forward looking anonymity set.",
    "point_5": "Tor can be connected for Bitcoin network and coordinator communication, but it’s not bundled in. If enabled, your Tor identity updates between input and output registration. You can also connect your own node through the RPC interface or with a private Electrum server.",
    "point_6": "You can mix into another Sparrow wallet such as a multi-signature or hardware wallet, and also target a number of mixing rounds before sending the UTXO to the other wallet.",
    "point_7": "Once you set up mixing in Sparrow and the premix transaction, the coinjoin transactions will be automated and mixing will continue if you leave the software open.",
    "point_8": "You can enter a promo code SCODE when registering bitcoin with Whirlpool for discounted coordinator fees during social media promotions."
  },
  "tradeoffs": {
    "point_1": "Fees can be high: if you register one single UTXO to coinjoin, you pay 3.5%-5% in coordinator fees and some extra in mining fees. ",
    "point_2": "Since the maximum anonymity set gain per Whirlpool coinjoin transaction is 8, many users want to remix many times. This may result in longer waiting times.",
    "point_3": "Toxic change is not eliminated, it is simply segregated into another wallet account. You will have to deal with those non-private outputs in the future.",
    "point_4": "The premix transaction (Tx0) will incur transaction mining fees, which elevates the cost of the mixing experience. ",
    "point_5": "There’s a minimum amount of 0.001 BTC to coinjoin on Whirlpool, which limits accessibility. ",
    "point_6": "Electrum SPV network connection is used by default which allows public servers to connect all the UTXOs from your wallet, even the non-private ones with the private ones.",
    "point_7": "Tor is not bundled with Sparrow and must be installed separately by the user, it’s not enabled by default. This can lead to IP address leakage to the coordinator, and to a public Electrum server (if you are not using your full node or a private Electrum server).",
    "point_8": "The Whirlpool coordinator is a centralized service that can technically censor UTXOs from using its service and this would not be verifiable by the public. ",
    "point_9": "The privacy objectives are not clear to the user. It's unknown if he's advised to mix two times, five times, or whatever."
