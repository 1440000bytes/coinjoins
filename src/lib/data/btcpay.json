  "overview": {
    "point_1": "WabiSabi is a third-generation coinjoin protocol that overcomes the limitations of the Zerolink protocol by allowing variable output amount denominations. This makes it possible to create coinjoin transactions without any toxic change.",
    "point_2": "As an admin user of your BTCPay server instance, you need to enable coinjoin in the plugin settings. A bitcoin hot wallet is required, and you should only use it if you own the BTC.",
    "point_3": "By default, you connect to the zkSNACKs coinjoin coordinator. It guarantees at least 150 inputs for a transaction, but there can be more. The coordinator fee is 0.3% of the fresh bitcoin amount (fresh means not coinjoined before).",
    "point_4": "You can choose to use another WabiSabi coordinator, or you can set up your own coordinator (and configure fees and other settings) with a few clicks from the BTCPay Server interface. Coordinators can be published on Nostr for easy discovery.",
    "point_5": "There are two configuration modes: pleb as the default, and scientist as the fully customizable option. Default settings are an anonymity score target of 5, and batched payments set to on.",
    "point_6": "Batched payments is a feature that allows you to schedule transactions on your bitcoin hot wallet that are executed directly from a WabiSabi coinjoin transaction. BTCPay is the only coinjoin wallet that allows you to make payments directly from a coinjoin transaction.",
    "point_7": "Other scientist mode settings include: mining fee limits in hours, minimum output denomination amount, consolidation mode, cautious coinjoin entry mode, mix funds between different coordinators, continuous coinjoin in percentage, send to other wallet, and finally only mix coins with (out) labels.",
    "point_8": "Once you have completed the setup by selecting the mode, coordinator, and agreeing to the coordinator's terms and conditions, the coinjoin process will automatically start, and you will be able to view the status in your BTCPay server store or wallet dashboard.",
    "point_9": "BTCPay server instance has its own Bitcoin node for transaction history retrieval, so you don't depend on third parties.",
    "point_10": "All traffic is routed through Tor by default, using different Tor hidden identities, making it harder to prove a relationship between your inputs. Tor is enabled by default when deploying a BTCPay Server instance."
  },
  "benefits": {
    "point_1": "With variable coinjoin output values and a large number of participants, WabiSabi coinjoins allow for an enormous number of possibilities, making it difficult to trace the flow of funds after a single transaction.",
    "point_2": "By default, the entire wallet and protocol run on Tor (it comes bundled in), protecting users (clients) from having their personal IP addresses exposed.",
    "point_3": "Toxic change outputs are eliminated in most cases, except for lone whales that have relatively large inputs compared to other inputs from the same coinjoin transaction.",
    "point_4": "By default, BTCPay Server uses the zkSNACKs coordinator, which provides the largest pool of liquidity for coinjoins.",
    "point_5": "Bitcoin network privacy is solved by the bundling of a Bitcoin Core node when deploying a BTCPay Server instance.",
    "point_6": "BTCPay Server is the most censorship-resistant WabiSabi bitcoin wallet because you can browse coordinators on Nostr (uncensored social media platform) and also run your own coordinator and publish it for discoverability.",
    "point_7": "BTCPay is the only coinjoin wallet that allows you to make payments directly from a coinjoin transaction using the Batched Payments feature.",
    "point_8": "A default setting mode called “pleb mode” is available with a default coordinator (zkSNACKs) so that new users can easily start the coinjoin process. However, extensive customization is possible for more advanced users.",
    "point_9": "Unlike on Wasabi Wallet, a user can set the minimum output denomination amount so you have full control and avoid creating uneconomical outputs when mining fees go up.",
    "point_10": "There’s transaction labeling, coin control, and an anonymity score target for each coin, to allow for very precise coin selection."
  },
  "tradeoffs": {
    "point_1": "The default coordinator (zkSNACKs) buys data from a chain analysis provider to prevent some inputs from registering with its coinjoin service. While there is no privacy tradeoff, this setup lacks censorship resistance. It can be fixed by changing coordinators or using your own.",
    "point_2": "There don't seem to be many high liquidity coordinator alternatives to the default zkSNACKs.",
    "point_3": "It's harder to run your own BTCPay server instance than it is to install a desktop or mobile wallet application. To use the WabiSabi coinjoin plugin, you need to install it after deploying BTCPay. It's mandatory to use coinjoin only on your own instance because you need to use a hot wallet."
