  "overview": {
    "point_1": "Joinstr aims to decentralize the coinjoin coordinator to solve the censorship resistance of coinjoin rounds, making it available as an Electrum Wallet plugin for desktop, as well as a web application, and a CLI, with the latter two requiring the use of Bitcoin Core as a wallet.",
    "point_2": "It is not currently available on the Bitcoin mainnet network and usage with real money is strongly discouraged.",
    "point_3": "To utilize Joinstr, users first select an input they wish to include in the next coinjoin round. Once participants are selected, the process begins.",
    "point_4": "The Nostr relay coordinator receives an output of the same denomination from each participant with the sighash flag ALL|ANYONECANPAY, after which each participant registers and signs the previously selected input of the same denomination.",
    "point_5": "After all participants are registered and signed, everyone receives the final transaction, which is automatically broadcasted to the network by Nostr relays, with each participant contributing an equal amount for mining fees.",
    "point_6": "Each step of the process involves publishing a Nostr event and using a new public/private key pair to enhance privacy.",
    "point_7": "The protocol allows for customization of the number of participants and the denomination of the output amount, with current settings being 5 participants and an output denomination of 0.10 BTC.",
    "point_8": "There is no Tor dependency for Joinstr, but it can be used with it. All communications between the Nostr relay and the participants leverage the riseupVPN API, a free service.",
    "point_9": "DoS vectors can be reduced by using encrypted Nostr channels for each round and encouraging users to try paid, private, custom Nostr relays."
  },
 "benefits": {
    "point_1": "Joinstr is as censorship-resistant as Nostr, making it the most censorship-resistant of the coordinator-based coinjoin protocols, but the long-term resilience of Nostr remains to be proven.",
    "point_2": "The coordinator steps are simplified by the introduction of outputs with the sighash flag ALL|ANYONECANPAY.",
    "point_3": "The protocol allows for customization in terms of the number of participants and the denominations of the output amounts.",
    "point_4": "It builds on top of proven and well-known wallets such as Electrum Wallet (Desktop) and Bitcoin Core. Electum allows you to connect to your own node through the middleware of an Electrum server.",
    "point_5": "It avoids Tor dependency by using the riseupVPN API for network communication to avoid leaking the participants' IP addresses.",
    "point_6": "There are no coordinator fees and each user contributes the same amount for mining fees. Participants would each pay about 2000 sats using the 10 sat/vbyte fee rate for the coinjoin transaction, with the mempool.space API used for fee estimation.",
    "point_7": "There are no non-private toxic change outputs produced by Joinstr coinjoin transactions, allowing users to prepare their outputs according to the pool they wish to be a part of. On the Electrum Plugin, users can manually choose the output addresses of a Joinstr coinjoin transaction.",
    "point_8": "Joinstr's DoS attack vector protection creates an incentive for paid, private, and custom Nostr relays.",
    "point_9": "Unlike Joinmarket, fidelity bonds are not required because Joinstr is not a peer-to-peer marketplace of takers and makers, but rather relies on Nostr relays for coinjoin coordination."
  },
  "tradeoffs": {
    "point_1": "It is not currently available on the Bitcoin mainnet network and it is strongly discouraged to use it with real money. Many of the features are still in development.",
    "point_2": "Because it hasn't been deployed with real money, it hasn't been well stress tested for Sybil, DoS, liquidity, and blockchain deanonymization and network privacy attack vectors.",
    "point_3": "The web and CLI applications require the deployment of a Bitcoin Core node, which consumes hundreds of GBs of bandwidth, disk space (pruning is possible), and time.",
    "point_4": "There is no anonymity rating or other way to quantify the privacy value of a Joinstr coinjoin transaction."
